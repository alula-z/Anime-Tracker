# Anime Tracker

A personal anime tracking application built with SwiftUI to help organize and manage anime watching progress.

## Overview

Anime Tracker is a mobile app designed to help anime enthusiasts keep track of their viewing progress, maintain watchlists, and organize their anime collection. This project demonstrates my skills in data management, user interface design, and mobile app development using SwiftUI.

## Features

### Currently Implemented
- âœ… Add anime titles to personal collection
- âœ… Track watching status (Plan to Watch, Watching, Completed, On Hold, Dropped)
- âœ… Episode progress tracking
- âœ… Basic search and filtering functionality
- âœ… Clean, intuitive SwiftUI interface

### In Development
- ðŸ”„ Rating system for completed anime
- ðŸ”„ Personal notes and reviews
- ðŸ”„ Data persistence with Core Data
- ðŸ”„ Anime cover art integration

## Screenshots

*[Screenshots will be added as features are completed]*

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI** - User interface framework
- **Swift** - Primary programming language
- **Core Data** - Local data persistence (planned)
- **Xcode** - Development environment

## Architecture

The app follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to maintain clean separation of concerns and improve testability.

## Current Status

This project is actively **in development**. The core tracking functionality is working, with ongoing improvements to data management and user experience.

### Completed Features
- Basic anime entry and status tracking
- Simple list views and navigation
- Episode counter functionality

### Known Limitations
- Data doesn't persist between app sessions yet
- Limited anime information (manual entry only)
- Basic UI styling needs refinement
- No offline data backup

### Next Steps
- [ ] Implement Core Data for persistent storage
- [ ] Add anime cover art and detailed information
- [ ] Integrate with anime database API (MyAnimeList or similar)
- [ ] Improve UI/UX with better styling and animations
- [ ] Add export functionality for backup
- [ ] Implement search with external anime database

## Learning Outcomes

Building this anime tracker has helped me develop skills in:

- Complex state management across multiple views
- Data modeling and relationships
- User interface design for data-heavy applications
- Navigation patterns in SwiftUI
- Planning and implementing persistent data storage
- Working with lists, forms, and user input handling

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `AnimeTracker.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run on iOS Simulator or device (iOS 15.0+)

### How to Use
1. Launch the app
2. Add anime titles using the "+" button
3. Set watching status and episode progress
4. Use filters to organize your collection
5. Update progress as you watch

## Future Enhancements

- **API Integration**: Connect to MyAnimeList or AniList for comprehensive anime data
- **Social Features**: Share progress with friends
- **Statistics**: Viewing history and analytics
- **Recommendations**: Suggest anime based on completed titles
- **Dark Mode**: Enhanced visual experience
- **Apple Watch**: Quick progress updates

## Technical Challenges

This project has presented interesting challenges including:
- Managing complex data relationships between anime, episodes, and user progress
- Designing intuitive UX for data entry and organization
- Planning for scalable data architecture
